# This is the the document that will brief you about what i am going to do in the Share Market project for now nothing has been decided but that i'll have to do something to have greater insight about the share markets.

For now nothing has been done in the  project and today is 2020-03-18
A Small change was made to verify how git tracks the changes made to the files and then maintains the repository

Here we are going to make small changes to the file and the we will add the modified file to the Staging area , 

	git add filename
After this we will remove file from the staging are
	git reset HEAD filename
 and here  though the file will be removed from the staging area but the changes that were made to the file will not be undone
This can be verified by opening the file


Let me add a comment and then i'll have to remove the comment from this. So that this line will not be visible to me after sometime
